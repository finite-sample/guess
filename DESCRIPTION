Description: Provides tools to adjust estimates of learning for guessing-related 
    bias in educational and survey research. Implements standard guessing 
    correction methods and a sophisticated latent class model that leverages 
    informative pre-post test transitions to account for guessing behavior. 
    The package helps researchers obtain more accurate estimates of actual 
    learning when respondents may guess on closed-ended knowledge items.
